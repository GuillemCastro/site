        <p>
            I'm a Software Engineer based in Barcelona. I currently work at GTD, making <a href="https://iter.org">ITER</a> a reality. In the past I used to make rockets at <a href="https://cosmicresearch.org">Cosmic Research</a>, an student association I co-founded with some friends.

            In this blog I'll talk about everything I love. Anything computer or software-related, politics (yes I am one of those...) or anything else that crosses my mind.
